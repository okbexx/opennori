description: Route OpenNori work through user-centered acceptance criteria, evidence, project health, and reporting Skills.
---

## When to use
Use when the user mentions OpenNori, asks to use OpenNori for a task, continue OpenNori, check completion, inspect project health, define acceptance criteria, record evidence, manage capability preferences, or produce an OpenNori report.

## Route
- Goal, acceptance discovery, brainstorm, approval, or AC revision -> use `nori-acceptance`.
- Verification, evidence sufficiency, human confirmation, waiver, or why an AC is passing -> use `nori-evidence`.
- Required Skills, preferred stacks, avoided tools, or install policy -> use `nori-capability-profile`.
- Architecture baseline, architecture profile selection, applying baseline before implementation, architecture challenge, or build-vs-buy -> use `nori-architecture-brainstorm`, `nori-architecture-apply`, `nori-architecture-challenge`, or `nori-build-vs-buy`.
- Install, upgrade, uninstall, doctor, manifest, Plugin health, or project recoverability -> use `nori-project-health`.
- Status, report, current gap, completion answer, user intervention, or change summary -> use `nori-reporting`.

## Baseline
At the start of each OpenNori turn, run `opennori bootstrap --root <repo> --json` if project readiness is unknown; otherwise run `opennori list --root <repo> --json`, then use `opennori resume --root <repo> --goal <goal-id> --json` or `opennori status --root <repo> --goal <goal-id> --json` when multiple active goals exist.
If bootstrap returns `needs_confirm`, show the preview briefly and ask the user before rerunning with `--confirm`.
For non-trivial goals, make sure an Architecture Baseline exists before implementation. Use `nori-architecture-brainstorm` to establish it and `nori-architecture-apply` before each implementation loop.
Use `next_recommendation` and top-level `next_actions` to continue the OpenNori loop; do not make the user repeatedly ask what the next step is.
When a complete goal returns `next_recommendation.candidate_goals`, use those candidates to start the next acceptance loop if the user has asked to continue. Choose or refine one human-facing goal, then route to `nori-acceptance` for discovery or draft. Do not present candidate goals as phases, task lists, approved AC, or evidence.
If `opennori` is not on PATH, use the installed package binary such as `node ./node_modules/opennori/bin/opennori.js` or this repository's `node ./bin/opennori.js` with the same arguments.

## Rule
Progress is determined by acceptance evidence, not implementation steps.
Architecture Baseline is sticky after user confirmation. Challenge it with evidence; do not silently replace it.
Do not make the user remember CLI syntax or internal Skill names.
Do not answer confidently complete while the acceptance basis is draft, required AC/profile evidence is missing, `acceptance_review` has findings, `architecture_check` has warnings, `evidence_health` needs review, or `profile_review` risks remain. If all required ACs have passing evidence but review findings remain, say the goal is objectively complete with review risk and ask the user how to handle the risk.
If active evidence is missing, stale, invalid, obsolete, or no longer proves the current AC, route to `nori-evidence` and prune it before reporting completion.
Do not suggest project-local OpenNori Skill installation or sync. OpenNori Skills come from the package Plugin; CLI commands only manage `.opennori` state.
