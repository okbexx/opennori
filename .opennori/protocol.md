# OpenNori Protocol

OpenNori is the product; Nori is the agent-facing role that turns goals into Nori Contracts.

The human-facing surface is acceptance state:

- goal
- user acceptance criteria
- current acceptance gap
- evidence summary
- final status

Implementation plans are allowed inside the agent's private reasoning, but they are not the default
progress surface and they are not completion evidence.

## Layered Acceptance Criteria v1

OpenNori itself is accepted only when it satisfies user-tool-operation acceptance criteria.

Each criterion must follow this shape:

```text
As a user,
using [tool or entrypoint],
I perform [concrete operation],
and can [make a judgment or take an action],
within [measurable threshold].
```

The first complete OpenNori acceptance set is layered. The layers prevent the project from
mistaking a working protocol kernel for the complete product.

### L1 Protocol AC

The protocol layer proves that the repository can hold a Nori Contract, evidence record,
current gap, risk gate, and report.

| ID | Tool / entrypoint | User operation | User acceptance criterion | Passing threshold |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AC-P-1 | Editor / file browser | Open the active Nori Contract | The user understands goal, layered ACs, each status, and the current gap. | No chat history or implementation explanation required; understandable within 60 seconds. |
| AC-P-2 | CLI | Run `opennori check` | The user can reject technical implementation details masquerading as ACs. | Files, fields, commands, tests, or modules cannot be accepted as user ACs by themselves. |
| AC-P-3 | CLI | Run `opennori next` or `opennori status` | The user sees the current acceptance gap and completion answer, not a process-step list. | Output answers which AC is missing, whether complete, and whether human action is required. |
| AC-P-4 | CLI / report | Inspect a high-risk AC | The user sees that weak evidence cannot make it passing. | High-risk passing cannot rely only on agent self-summary. |
| AC-P-5 | CLI / Codex | Trigger `opennori report` | The user sees goal, layered AC statuses, evidence summaries, current gap, intervention, and conclusion. | Report is organized by acceptance state and evidence, not process steps. |
| AC-P-6 | CLI / report | Inspect evidence basis | The user can tell what evidence supports passing, blocked, or waived ACs. | Report/status shows evidence summary, basis, confidence, and limitations, not only an agent conclusion. |
| AC-P-7 | CLI / report | Review evidence sources | The user can review evidence sources without constraining how the agent gathered them. | Sources can be commands, artifacts, URLs, screenshots, diffs, human confirmations, or other reviewable references. |
| AC-P-8 | CLI / report | Compare evidence basis types | The user can distinguish tool observations, human confirmations, artifact reviews, protocol checks, and agent observations. | Evidence basis is shown clearly and agent judgment is not disguised as tool or human verification. |
| AC-P-9 | CLI / report | Inspect reviewability and limitations | The user sees how to review evidence and what it does not cover. | Report shows reviewability and limitations for structured evidence. |
| AC-P-10 | CLI / report | Inspect combined evidence sources | The user can see one AC supported by multiple sources. | Evidence can contain multiple sources without forcing them into fixed adapters. |
| AC-P-11 | Codex conversation | Ask the agent to record a verification as evidence | The user does not need to remember evidence CLI flags. | The OpenNori Skill tells the agent to choose a suitable verification method, then record basis, sources, reviewability, confidence, and limitations. |

### L2 Operator AC

The operator layer proves that Codex can actually use OpenNori as the work protocol in conversation.

| ID | Tool / entrypoint | User operation | User acceptance criterion | Passing threshold |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AC-O-1 | Codex conversation | Start a task with "use OpenNori for this goal" | The user sees a draft Nori Contract written from the user's perspective. | Draft ACs describe user actions or judgments; user can approve or revise. |
| AC-O-2 | Codex conversation | Approve or revise the acceptance criteria | The user controls what "done" means. | Agent cannot decide completion before user-confirmed criteria exist. |
| AC-O-3 | New Codex session | Ask to continue OpenNori | The agent restores the active goal and current acceptance gap. | Recovery uses repo files, not old chat context. |
| AC-O-4 | Codex conversation | Ask "is it done?" | The agent answers only from required AC status and evidence. | Complete is allowed only when required ACs are all `passing` or `waived`. |
| AC-O-5 | Codex conversation | Ask "what do I need to do?" | If blocked, the user sees a concrete human action. | Blocked output asks for a decision, input, permission, cost approval, or similar human action. |
| AC-O-6 | Codex conversation | Revise an AC after new facts appear | The changed acceptance basis is preserved. | Updated ACs become the basis for `current_gap` and completion; old criteria are not silently reused. |
| AC-O-7 | Codex conversation | Ask OpenNori to brainstorm a fuzzy idea | The user sees selectable acceptance directions without remembering CLI syntax. | Brainstorm candidates describe user value, observable acceptance direction, and risk; they are not treated as a contract or completion evidence. |
| AC-O-8 | Codex conversation | State required Skills, preferred stacks, avoided tools, or execution constraints | The agent records a Nori Profile without making the user remember CLI syntax. | Must/avoid profile items are shown in contract and report; unsatisfied must items or violated avoid items block completion unless waived. |

### L3 Productization AC

The productization layer proves that OpenNori can be installed, reused, reviewed, and cleaned up as
a durable workflow asset.

| ID | Tool / entrypoint | User operation | User acceptance criterion | Passing threshold |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AC-Z-1 | CLI | Run `opennori skill export` | The user gets a usable Codex Skill draft for OpenNori. | The Skill tells agents to drive work through resume, next, evidence, evaluate, status, and report. |
| AC-Z-2 | CLI | Run `opennori install` | The user can install OpenNori into a project without unexpected overwrites. | Install shows created/skipped assets; existing user content is not overwritten by default. |
| AC-Z-3 | Git / PR diff | Review the agent's changes | The user can separate acceptance evidence changes from implementation noise. | Summary defaults to AC status changes, evidence changes, and user impact. |
| AC-Z-4 | CLI | Run `opennori list` and select a goal | The user can see multiple active goals and choose one explicitly. | Multiple active goals are listed with status, gap, and paths; `--goal` selects the target. |
| AC-Z-5 | CLI | Archive a completed or blocked goal | The user removes it from active work while preserving evidence and report. | Active no longer lists the goal; contract, ledger, and report remain recoverable. |
| AC-Z-6 | Project file browser | Inspect the project after running OpenNori | The user sees OpenNori-owned state under `.opennori/` instead of a generic project `process/` directory. | Install, draft, brainstorm, report, and archive write OpenNori state under `.opennori/` by default. |
| AC-Z-7 | CLI / project file browser | Run `opennori install` | The user can inspect project OpenNori registration and judge version, managed entries, active goals, Skill status, and protocol capabilities. | Install output uses create, skip, overwrite, or update semantics; `.opennori/manifest.json` records version, managed files, active goals, Skill state, and capabilities. |
| AC-Z-8 | CLI | Run `opennori doctor` | The user can judge whether the project is `ready`, `needs-action`, or `broken`, and see the next recovery action. | Doctor checks `.opennori` structure, manifest consistency, active goal recoverability, Skill sync, CLI runtime, and recovery suggestions. |
| AC-Z-9 | CLI | Preview install with `opennori install --dry-run` | The user can judge what OpenNori would create, skip, update, or overwrite before writing to the project. | Install plan lists action, kind, managed status, write intent, destructive flag, and reason; dry-run reports zero actual writes. |
| AC-Z-10 | CLI | Apply force install | The user must preview and explicitly confirm destructive install actions before files are overwritten. | Real `opennori install --force` fails without confirmation; dry-run previews destructive overwrites; confirmed force install may write. |
| AC-Z-11 | CLI | Preview and apply uninstall | The user can uninstall OpenNori entry assets without losing acceptance state by default. | Uninstall plan shows removals and preserved state; real uninstall requires confirmation; `.opennori` state is deleted only with `--include-state --confirm`. |
| AC-Z-12 | CLI / Codex Skills | Install OpenNori Skill Pack | The agent gets focused OpenNori Skills for acceptance, evidence, Nori Profile, project health, and reporting while the user keeps using natural language. | `opennori skill export --pack` exposes the pack; `opennori install --skill` writes it; manifest records `skill_pack`; doctor detects missing or stale pack Skills. |

## Required Artifact Pair

OpenNori writes its project-local state under `.opennori/`.

```text
.opennori/
  manifest.json
  protocol.md
  active/
    <goal>.acceptance.md
    <goal>.evidence.json
  completed/
  blocked/
  reports/
  brainstorms/
```

Each active goal has:

- `<goal>.acceptance.md` for human review
- `<goal>.evidence.json` for deterministic agent/tool updates

`.opennori/manifest.json` records the project-local OpenNori registration:

- manifest schema and OpenNori protocol version
- OpenNori package version
- managed `.opennori` files and directories
- active goals recoverable from `.opennori/active`
- optional repo-local OpenNori Skill state
- optional repo-local OpenNori Skill Pack state
- protocol capabilities exposed by this CLI

`opennori install` creates or refreshes the manifest. State-changing OpenNori commands refresh it when
`.opennori/` already exists.

`opennori install --dry-run` returns an install plan. The plan uses deterministic action semantics:

- `create`: missing OpenNori asset would be created
- `exists`: required OpenNori directory already exists
- `skip`: existing file is preserved because `--force` was not used
- `overwrite`: existing file would be overwritten because `--force` was used
- `update`: generated OpenNori state, such as the manifest, would be refreshed

Each planned action also reports `kind`, `managed`, `would_write`, `will_write`, `destructive`,
and a short human-readable reason.

Real `opennori install --force` can overwrite OpenNori-managed files, so it requires explicit confirmation.
Run `opennori install --dry-run --force` first to inspect destructive actions, then rerun with
`--confirm` only if those writes are acceptable.

`opennori uninstall --dry-run` returns an uninstall plan. By default it removes entry assets such as the
repo-local OpenNori Skill and manifest, while preserving Nori Contracts, evidence records,
reports, archives, and brainstorms. Real uninstall requires `--confirm`. Deleting the whole `.opennori`
state directory requires both `--include-state` and `--confirm`.

## Skill Pack

OpenNori exposes a Skill Pack for agent use. The user should not need to remember these Skill names;
the root `nori` Skill routes natural-language requests to focused Skills:

- `nori`: root router for OpenNori turns
- `nori-acceptance`: discover AC gaps, brainstorm, draft, approve, and revise human-facing ACs
- `nori-evidence`: record reviewable evidence without forcing fixed adapters
- `nori-capability-profile`: record required Skills, preferred stacks, avoided tools, and install policy
- `nori-project-health`: install, uninstall, doctor, manifest, and Skill Pack sync
- `nori-reporting`: status, report, current gap, user intervention, and changes

`opennori install --skill` installs the pack under `.agents/skills/`. The manifest records `skill_pack`
state, and `opennori doctor` checks whether the pack is installed and in sync.

When upgrading an existing OpenNori project, upgrade entry assets first, then run `opennori check`.
`check` validates active Nori Contracts and reports `acceptance_quality` warnings for vague ACs
such as "modify profile fields" or "show an error". It does not rewrite existing contracts, evidence,
reports, archives, or brainstorms. The user decides whether to revise affected criteria.

## Nori Profile

Acceptance criteria remain human-facing outcomes. A Nori Profile is separate execution
guidance for the agent when the user says things like:

- must use an existing Skill
- prefer a library or stack
- avoid a tool
- ask before installing a dependency
- follow a project-specific constraint

Profile items have:

- `type`: `skill`, `stack`, or `constraint`
- `strength`: `must`, `prefer`, or `avoid`
- `purpose`: why the user wants it
- `install_policy`: `existing_only`, `ask_before_install`, or `allowed`

Completion rules:

- `must` blocks completion until satisfied or waived.
- `prefer` is reported but does not block completion.
- `avoid` blocks completion if violated.

Agents translate the user's natural-language preferences into profile records. Users should not
need to remember `opennori profile` commands.

## Status Model

- `unknown`: no user-understandable evidence exists
- `failing`: evidence shows the criterion is not satisfied
- `passing`: evidence shows the criterion is satisfied
- `blocked`: user decision or external condition required
- `waived`: user explicitly accepts the unmet criterion with a reason

The workflow is complete only when every required criterion is `passing` or `waived`.

## Risk Gate

OpenNori separates acceptance status from evidence strength.

For `high` risk criteria, weak evidence cannot make an AC `passing`. If an agent submits
`passing` evidence with a weak kind, OpenNori downgrades the criterion to `failing` with
`confidence: strong-evidence-required`.

Strong evidence kinds:

- `test-summary`
- `screenshot`
- `artifact`
- `review-result`
- `human-confirmation`
- `protocol-v1`

Strong explicit confidence values:

- `verified`
- `reviewed`
- `human-confirmed`

This keeps high-risk completion from relying on agent self-summary.

## Free Evidence Structure

OpenNori does not require the agent to use a fixed set of evidence adapters. The agent may choose the
verification approach that fits the task: tests, Git diff, screenshots, browser checks, logs,
artifacts, URLs, AW doctor, human confirmation, or another reviewable signal.

When the agent submits evidence, the user-facing record should explain:

- `basis`: why this evidence can support the AC, such as `tool-observation`,
  `human-confirmation`, `artifact-review`, `protocol-check`, or `agent-observation`
- `sources`: one or more reviewable references, each with a label and optional command, path, URL,
  outcome, or other useful metadata
- `reviewability`: how the user can rerun, reopen, inspect, or otherwise review the evidence
- `confidence`: the evidence strength used by completion and risk gates
- `limitations`: what the evidence does not cover

The shape is intentionally open. OpenNori should preserve arbitrary source metadata instead of forcing
all evidence through a narrow adapter taxonomy.

## Agent Rule

On every turn:

1. If the user gives a fuzzy goal or candidate AC, run `opennori discover --goal "<goal>" --root <repo> --json` before drafting.
2. Ask only the discovery questions that affect completion judgment. Do not turn discovery gaps into implementation tasks or completion evidence.
3. If the user wants to discuss, brainstorm, explore, or is not ready to define acceptance criteria, run `opennori brainstorm --idea "<idea>" --root <repo> --json`.
4. Show only candidate acceptance directions and ask the user to choose or revise a direction. Brainstorm output is not a contract or completion evidence.
5. If the user chooses a candidate, run `opennori draft --from-brainstorm <brainstorm-id> --candidate <A|B|C> --root <repo> --json`.
6. If the user starts with "use OpenNori" / "用 OpenNori 跑这个任务" and discovery gaps are answered or explicitly accepted as assumptions, run `opennori draft --goal "<goal>" --root <repo> --json`.
7. Show the draft acceptance criteria and ask the user to approve or revise them.
8. After approval, run `opennori approve --root <repo> --summary "<approval>" --json`.
9. If the user states required Skills, preferred stacks, avoided tools, install policy, or execution constraints, run `opennori profile add --root <repo> ... --json` and keep those items out of the user acceptance criteria.
10. If the user revises a criterion later, run `opennori criterion update --root <repo> --criterion <id> ... --json`; old evidence for the changed criterion is cleared.
11. If the user asks to upgrade an existing OpenNori project, run `opennori doctor`, preview and confirm `opennori upgrade`, then run `opennori check`; ask the user before revising any existing AC flagged by `acceptance_quality`.
12. Run `opennori resume --root <repo>` or `opennori next --root <repo>` to recover the active goal and current acceptance gap from repository files.
13. Work only to produce evidence for that gap.
14. Add acceptance evidence with `opennori evidence add`; choose any suitable verification method, but record basis, sources, reviewability, confidence, and limitations. Add profile compliance evidence with `opennori profile evidence` when profile items exist.
15. Run `opennori evaluate`.
16. Report acceptance state, profile compliance, and evidence, not implementation steps.
